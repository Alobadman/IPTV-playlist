Locked away against her will, but determined to fight for her freedom, she and four other girls battle everything from serpents tosamurais on an unbelievable journey to set themselves free. Like \&quot;Alice in Wonderland with machine guns,\&quot; Snyder&apos;s epic action fantasy is filmed in such a way that the action sequences aren&apos;t limited by physical real...</desc></programme>
